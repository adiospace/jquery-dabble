#Dabbleback

As I was surfing the net, I've stumble upon http://dabble.in which uses a background full of colorful divs, and as you hover your mouse over them, a CSS transition is applied to leave a grey mark over the divs which fades away after 5 sec or so.

This is a generator that builds such backgrounds. It takes a photo, read it with the File API, draw it on a HTML5 canvas and take the colors out of it. Then, it generates the actual HTML with colorful divs.
