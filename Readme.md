#Dabbleback

As I was surfing I've stumble upon http://dabble.in site which uses a background full of colorful divs 
and as you hover your mouse over them a CSS transition is applied to leave a grey mark over the divs which fades away after 5 sec or so.

This is a generator that builds such backgrounds. It takes a photo, read it with the File API, 
draw it on a HTML5 canvas and take the colors out of it. Then it generates the actual HTML with colorful divs.
